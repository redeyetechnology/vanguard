/**
 * This event is emitted if a player is banned from the server. Developers should consider subscribing to the event bus
 * for Vanguard's common module, as this event originates from there. However, this Bukkit event is provided for the
 * convenience of developers who do not wish to use the common module, and also allows internal mechanisms within
 * Vanguard to subscribe to the event and handle it appropriately.
 *
 * @param uuid The UUID of the player.
 * @param player The VanguardPlayer object of the player, if they are online.
 * @param originName The name of the origin of the ban.
 * @param origin The VanguardOrigin object of the origin of the ban.
 * @param reason The reason for the ban.
 * @param duration The duration of the ban.
 * @param server The server the warning was issued on (as defined in the server's configuration).
